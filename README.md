# **Clinic Appointment Manager**

**Clinic Appointment Manager** is a simple web application built with Flask and MySQL. It helps small clinics manage appointments, check staff availability, avoid booking conflicts, and send basic email reminders. The goal of this project is to learn how a full-stack Flask app works — from database design to backend scheduling logic to a simple web interface.
